2. XML Command Reply
	A command reply will be sent in response to all properly formatted XML commands. If an XML command reply is not received then the most likely cause is that the XML command was not recognized and hence a command reply could not be sent.
	
	All XML command replies that are sent in response to a recognized XML command will have the status attribute returned. A status attribute value of ack is returned if the contents of the XML command were executed. A status attribute value of nack is returned if any part of the XML command could not executed. This implies that in multiple operation XML commands it is possible that some portion of the command was executed and other portions were not. In order to avoid this condition the Host application could structure XML commands so that only one operation is specified in each XML command. Thus, multiple XML commands of single operation would be equivalent to one XML command with multiple operations.

	The panelid attribute is always returned in all XML command replies. The value of panelid represents an unique identifier that the Host application may use in determining originating panel. The panelid is a 12 digit hexadecimal number i.e. 0050c23d8000.

	The standart event attributes:
		panelid: %s - panel ID (GUID)
		eventid: %d - unique event ID
		date: %s - current date. The value of date is set to the date of the event in yyyy/mm/dd format
		time: %s - current time. The value of time is set to the time of the event in hh:mm:ss 24 hour clock format

		door: %d - door ID
		error: %s - error description. This attribute will be returned if the status is nack

3. XML Events
	XML events originate at the SmartDoors and are sent to the Host application asynchronously at the time the actual physical event occurs.

	The panelid attribute is returned in all XML events. The value of panelid represents an unique identifier that the Host application may use in determining originating panel. The panelid is a 12 digit hexadecimal number i.e. 0050c23d8000.

	3.1 XML <doorevent> Event
